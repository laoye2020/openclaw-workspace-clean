## User Preferences Captured

### PREF-001: Embedding Provider Preference
**Type:** preference  
**Area:** configuration

**Preference:** Due to OpenAI API credit card recurring rejections, user prefers to switch to alternative embedding providers for long-term memory (openclaw-mem).

**Preferred Options (in order):**
1. **Jina AI** - Immediate solution, OpenAI-compatible API format, generous free tier
2. **Local Ollama** - Permanent solution, completely free, run nomic-embed-text locally
3. **Kimi Embedding** - Preferred Chinese provider, requires API key
4. **MiniMax Embedding** - Alternative Chinese provider

**Context:** User explicitly asked about Kimi and MiniMax embedding alternatives to avoid OpenAI credit card issues. Recommended Jina AI as fastest migration path (compatible with OpenAI format, just change baseUrl and key).

**Type:** fact  
**Area:** communication

**Context:** User clarified after multiple "11" messages: "11是测试连通信 你不用管" (11 is just a connectivity test, you don't need to respond).

**Status:** ✅ Gateway config patched and restarted successfully

## Session Notes

### Bot Routing Clarification
User explicitly stated that:
- **Main bot (@laoye001_bot)** should handle general conversation and replies
- **Trader bot (@laoye_trader_bot)** should ONLY push market data, not engage in chat

Previous confusion was due to session routing - now corrected.

### Heartbeat Protocol
User prefers minimal heartbeat responses: "只回复 main ok" (Only reply "main ok").
